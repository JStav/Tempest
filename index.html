			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>The <a href="http://tempe.st/tempest">Tempest Weather System</a> combines state-of-the-art sensors and a sleek, wireless design with WeatherFlow’s proprietary modeling capabilities to seamlessly present validated weather data and improved forecasts.</p>
			<p>While Tempest-supported apps and integrations offer ample functionality and a wealth of uses, our robust set of self serve developer tools enable even more complex integrations. To learn more about how to work with the API, visit our <a href="api/">Getting Started guide</a>.</p> 
			<p>The Tempest API & Developer Platform empowers developers to build useful applications and integrations by providing access to enhanced data and forecasts from the Tempest System. Visit the <a href="https://community.weatherflow.com/t/tempest-weather-system-third-party-applications/873">Tempest Community Forum</a> for a list of many third-party applications & integrations built by a talented community of developers. </p>
			<p>For uses that go beyond our self-serve developer tools, or to discuss an app or integration that would require access to data from the broader Tempest network, please <a href="https://weatherflow.com/partner-inquiry/">contact us</a> with a description of your idea - we’d love to hear about it.</p>
